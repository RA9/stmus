# Welcome To the St.Matthew United Methodist High School Website Repo

This is a project I decided to do for my school as legacy to them and you are all welcome to Collaborate.

## How I Can contribute to this Repo?
* Fork the repo on Github as your own
* Clone your fork repo to your machine and start collaborating
* After that the next step is to follow this command and when you are stuck call for help.
* We will be using the development branch so it is called **develop** for short 
* You should use `$ git checkout develop`
* When you are in the develop branch you can create a new branch and start working on the issue you are assign with.
* Use `$ git checkout -b <new branch>` and specify the name of the new branch .
* After you are done with your work use `$ git pull` 
* Then use `git add . ` to add all new files or like this `$ git add folder/*` for all the files in a directory
* Next commit the files like this `$ git commit -m "Initial commits"`
* At this point you should use `git status`
* Next use `git merge --no-ff origin/develop`
* Next use `git push -u origin/develop
* Then delete the new branch like this `git checkout -d <new branch>
* Now go to [Github](https://github.com/Ra9/stmus) and compare the files and pull a request
* Congrat you just collaborate on your first project
